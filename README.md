# Quote Classification and Interpretation

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and documentation for a project focused on the multi-label classification and interpretation of quotes using transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- `DistilBERT.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for fine-tuning and evaluating the DistilBERT model.
- `Error_Analysis_Classification.xlsx`: Spreadsheet containing error analysis for the classification tasks.
- `Error_Analysis_Interpretation.xlsx`: Spreadsheet containing error analysis for the interpretation tasks.
- `GPT2_multipleseeds.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for fine-tuning and evaluating the GPT-2 model.
- `Gemma.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for interpretation with the Gemma model.
- `NLP_Final_Report.pdf`: Detailed project report including methodology, results, and conclusions.
- `ProcessData.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for data processing and preprocessing tasks.
- `RoBERTa_Final.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for fine-tuning and evaluating the RoBERTa model.
- `T5-Class.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for fine-tuning and evaluating the T5 model.
- `T5_prompting.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for experimenting with prompting techniques for the T5 model.
- `final_classification.csv`: CSV file containing the final classification results.
- `final_interpretations.xlsx`: Spreadsheet containing the final interpretations of quotes.
